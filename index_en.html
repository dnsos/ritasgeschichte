      <h4>Project</h4>
      <p>Told here is the story of Rita, a laying hen who experiences the different forms and stages of the egg industry. But Rita is no regular „egg-worker“. Little by little, she discovers her own basic instincts and does not hesitate to fight for them.</p>

      <p>This project aims to provide an overview of regulations and conditions in the different stages of the <a href="https://albert-schweitzer-stiftung.de/massentierhaltung/legehennen" target="_blank">laying hen industry</a> <i>(hatchery, barn, free range, organic)</i> in Germany. These are encountered with positions that are predominantly derived from the lineage of the laying hens ancestors, the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankivahuhn" target="_blank">junglefowls</a>.</p>

      <p>Initially the project was created in german language, therefore all cited sources are only available in German.</p>
