Rita's life began something like this: a huge, noisy hall, stifling air and thousands of other egg-workers like Rita. But what kind of a life was that? The floor was made of hard bars, cracks and occasionally a bit of sawdust._[1]_ Where should one pick grass and worms here?_[2]_ One day, the farmer inadvertently left the hall's door open. Without further ado, Rita and her colleagues occupied the large meadow in front of the henhouse. They enjoyed themselves in dust baths and chased through the bushes. And when the farmer and his people wanted to push them back, a determined sitting strike on the meadow was initiated. The action was crowned with success: From now on the farmer allowed the hens to spend part of their days on the meadow._[3]_

> [1] In the barns live up to 6000 laying hens per unit. 1/3 of the stable area must be covered with sawdust or a similar material.
_See TierSchutzNutztV §13a_

> [2] In their natural environment, chickens spend more than half of their day foraging. They are omnivores and make their foraging mainly by pawing, pecking and hacking.

> [3] In free range farming, laying hens are given daytime access to an overgrown outdoor area.
