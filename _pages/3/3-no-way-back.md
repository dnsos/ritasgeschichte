Encouraged by this success, the hens wanted more. They had heard of a neighboring farm on which hens had more space in their local stable._[1]_ So Rita and the workers gathered all their strength, spread their barely used wings and fluttered over the fence of their meadow. They mingled cheerfully with the hens of the neighboring farm and exchanged stories. Thus they presented the farmer with a dilemma: the hens had now experienced the advantages of the neighboring farm with their own eyes and for them there was no way back to their smaller stable._[2]_ The farmer drove in – he decided to rebuild and expand his stables. "Organic products could be a new market" he grumbled.

> [1] In organic farming up to six animals can be found in the stable for one square meter.
_See Rat der Europäischen Union: Verordnung (EG) Nr. 1804/1999 (19.07.1999)._

> [2] Chicken need plenty of space for their daily urge to move. The jungle fowls, which are regarded as the ancestors of modern breeds of chicken, always keep their distance. Only when foraging small groups are formed, each one with a male animal.
