Rico was her brother. Growing up in their eggs, they communicated with picking sounds and exchanged the big plans they had for their lives. Until the day of their birth. When Rita was born, Rico was gone. He had already passed the shredder's rotating knives after the humans realized that Rico would not be able to lay eggs._[1]_ Since that day Rita vowed to fight for a good life, a life worthy of a chicken. A revolutionary was born.

> [1] In Germany male chickens have been killed directly after hatching for a long time. These animals are not older than one day.
