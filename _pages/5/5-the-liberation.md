Rita still lived together with 3000 other egg-workers._[1]_ The crampdness was a problem. There were also disputes and clashes between the hens time and time again. Eventually everyone knew that the space was not enough. So Rita started organizing the hens. She motivated the other workers and they began to form small councils and action groups._[2]_ All with the aim to lure the human workers in an ambush, to liberate the stable and to lead the life that they all never had but desired so much. They succeeded. **Rita had liberated the hens**.

> [1] Organic farming allows up to 3000 laying hens per unit.
_See: Rat der EuropÃ¤ischen Union: Verordnung (EG) Nr. 1804/1999 (19.07.1999)._

> [2] In the wild the herd size varies mostly between 16 and 40 animals. There is a pecking order.
